### Notes on {xaringan} slides

I updated my lightning talk into xaringan slides as I was inspired after attending Silvia Canelón's fantastic webinar at the conference: [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3skTMQbCD0) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAtpZxW4bTI).

Silvia's code can be found [here](https://github.com/spcanelon/xaringan-basics-and-beyond) and her slides for the workshop [here](https://github.com/spcanelon/xaringan-basics-and-beyond/tree/main/slides).
