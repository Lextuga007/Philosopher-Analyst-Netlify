### [SHAPE Altas](https://shapeatlas.net/)

A presentation for the Midlands Analyst Network where I showed how I'd used the tool to explore the public transport times between some of the Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust sites.

Slides created with {xaringan} and I used the `xaringanExtra::use_scribble(pen_color = "#003087")` during the presentation to highlight the boundaries.
