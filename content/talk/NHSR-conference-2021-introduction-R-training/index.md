Due to the popularity of the course in 2020 when I had 40 people attending which, in hindsight was a little ambitious as I'd only done a few workshops before the conference, I did indeed do another recording for the community. The funny thing is that, at the point of writing this, these recordings have only had 3 viewings and I think they were me finding the link! The original 2020 training has got hundreds of views!
