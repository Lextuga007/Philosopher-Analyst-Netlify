![NHS-R Community](featured-hex.png)

Due to the popularity of the course I had 40 people attending which, in hindsight was a little ambitious as I'd only done a few workshops before the conference!

At some point I will do another recording for the community.

The first workshop, on Monday 2nd November was the entire course whereas the Friday 6th November workshop was a cut down version covering dplyr.
