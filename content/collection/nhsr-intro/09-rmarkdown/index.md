# Template

In this Section I recommend that you open a [template RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) by going to <kbd> File/New File/R Markdown...</kbd>. The wizard will prompt for a Title that can be something like Test, then select <kbd>OK</kbd>.

Knit the file by selecting the wool and needle button just under the tab names, next to the magnifying icon. RStudio also has some great lessons [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

# Slightly more complex example

I then show the following report that I've built to show more of the text possibilities in R Markdown.

# A much more fancy and fantastic example from Simon Wellesley-Miller

I can never resist showing this final example, which Simon has talked through at the NHS-R Community Conference:

There are tons of examples of what you can put in an R Markdown from interactive, searchable tables to maps, it's a great catalogue of possibilities and worth reading too as Simon has made the report itself an enjoyable read.
