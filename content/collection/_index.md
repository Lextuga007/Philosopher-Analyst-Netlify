  Sometimes you want a souped-up series- a bundle of related pages 
  meant to be read in sequence. This section is like a blog series, 
  minus the blog.

        NHS-R Introduction to R and R Studio workshop slides. 
        The slides can be viewed here directly or expanded to full screen. 
        In the training I like to split my screen between the slides and live coding and the full screen doesn't work for that, so I use the GitHub pages that they feed from. The links can be found on the same page as the interactive slides.
        Slides have been converted to RMarkdown {xaringan} slides so resize within a web browser.
