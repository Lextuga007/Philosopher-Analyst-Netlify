I have been an analyst in the NHS for over a decade and a Senior Fellow of [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) providing training materials, 
open source books and, in its penultimate year before merging, facilitating the 
running of the community including organising webinars/workshops from 
volunteers and its successful in-person annual conference in Birmingham.

I have a particular interest in Ethics having studied Philosophy in a time before
disserations even needed to be typed and some of my 
thoughts on ethics, along with technical blogs, can be found on my distill
blog [site](https://lextuga007.github.io/PhilosopherAnalyst/).
