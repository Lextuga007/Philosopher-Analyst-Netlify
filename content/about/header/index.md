I work as a Senior Information Analyst at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust working with both R and SQL. 

I'm a Fellow of the [NHS-R Community](https://nhsrcommunity.com/) and I am the Non-Exec Director at [AphA (Association of Professional Healthcare Analysts)](https://www.aphanalysts.org/). NHS colleagues can use [Hexitime](https://hexitime.com/) time bank to exchange time and skills.

I have a particular interest in Ethics having studied Philosophy and some of my thoughts on this, along with technical blogs, can be found on my {distill} blog [site](https://lextuga007.github.io/PhilosopherAnalyst/).
