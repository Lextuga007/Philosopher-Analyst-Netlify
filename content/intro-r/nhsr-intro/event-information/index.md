## Who should attend / target audience

Data Analysts and anyone interested in learning about R.

The course is informal and is intended to help you feel comfortable with asking questions in the workshop and beyond the course through the NHS-R Community. 

## Pre-requisites: 
No prior knowledge of R is required; however, it is assumed that you will have a moderate level of computer literacy. For example, you will be able to navigate to drives and files and be confident in searching for solutions to technical problems on the internet. You will work with, or have an interest in, data. 

You are expected to have completed the [prework](https://philosopher-analyst.netlify.app/intro-r/nhsr-intro/prework/) to set up either a laptop with R, RStudio, some packages and download data or have access to and set up an account with [RStudio Connect](https://rstudio.cloud/). The RStudio Connect workspace has everything pre-loaded but still requires accessing through an account (some organisations may block this site too so please do check it in advance).


## What delegates will gain/ learning outcomes

### Why R:
R is one of the most powerful data science software solutions used the world over and is being actively promoted by the NHS-R Community. Analysts throughout the NHS and in Social Care are discovering the huge potentials of R which range from analytical and statistical work to creating websites and interactive reports. Itâ€™s a hugely flexible and versatile language that has far extended its original use for statistics.

### Learning Outcomes: 
After this one-day introduction, delegates will:
1.	See examples of R in producing healthcare related visualisations and use publicly available healthcare data to answer questions.  
2.	Recognise and understand key terms often used by users of R. 
 
### Furthermore, delegates will be able to:
1.	Interact with R using the RStudio environment.
2.	Learn how to set up some of the accessibility features of RStudio. 
3.	Take charge of their workflow using RStudio projects.
4.	Import data into R using csv files (other data sources will be discussed).
5.	Carry out data manipulation using simple steps to solve complex problems.
6.	Join multiple tables together.
7.	Produce and save plots using ggplot2.
8.	Learn how to find more information on functions within R packages.
9.	Open an RMarkdown template and learn how to get started in producing an integrated text and code report.
10.	Take away ideas for continuing learning after the course.
