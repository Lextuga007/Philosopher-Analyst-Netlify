The Clinical Development Unit (CDU) Data Science Team write [blogs](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/team-blog/) and we publish this through {distill}. 

As part of our work towards openness and transparency we set up a meeting at Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust for all staff to come to talk about data, called [Understanding Your Data](https://cdu-data-science-team.github.io/understanding-your-data/). As part of that I write up some of the discussions at a separate blog site, also created in {distill}.
