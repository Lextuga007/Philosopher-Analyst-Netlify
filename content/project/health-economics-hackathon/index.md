### Health Economics Hackathon 2019
---

This was the first Hackathon I had attended and I got to contribute to the writing fast Markov models group ([hermes6](https://github.com/HealthEconomicsHackathon/hermes6)) by compiling the [test scripts](https://github.com/HealthEconomicsHackathon/hermes6/tree/master/scripts).

I learned the power of working collaboratively with people from various specialities as the team had people who concentrated on the statistics, R and GitHub work flow.
