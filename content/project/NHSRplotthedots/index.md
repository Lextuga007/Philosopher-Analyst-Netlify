### Contributing

I haven't yet contributed any code for this package but attended many of the meetings with the team which I was really grateful for as it was wonderful to be included in such work, even with very little to contribute.

Chris Beeley invited the team to speak at the [NHS-Podcast](https://soundcloud.com/nhs-r-community/nhsr_plot_the_dots), which they recorded with me not present as I was unavailable but I felt that that was ok because I didn't think my contributions were that big. However, due to a technical glitch the podcast wasn't recorded fully so Chris arranged another session and the team insisted I still come. Unfortunately, I could attend but Simon Wellesley-Miller couldn't and so he's missing from the group but was heavily involved with the project. Getting analysts together like this is like herding cats!

I took the opportunity with my bit in the podcast to try to encourage other people in the community to get involved in projects like this, even if you don't feel you can contribute much. These are opportunities to build networks and learn from each other. It's wonderful to be part of something and the NHS-R Community is very friendly.

I also wanted to point out some of the [issues](https://github.com/nhs-r-community/NHSRplotthedots/issues) that I raised for the project around accessibility of images. These are things I hope we can get included into the code at some point and without issues like these, they can get overlooked or ignored. Contributions, however small they may seem, matter, so please do get involved where you can.
